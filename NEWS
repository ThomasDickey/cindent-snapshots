Release notes for GNU indent version 2.0, November 1998

* indent withstands the U. Wisconsin fuzz test. (See
  http://www.cs.wisc.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/ncstrl.uwmadison/CS-TR-95-1268
  for details.)

* indent compiles with gcc -Wall and MSVC++ with no warnings.

* C++ code is handled to a great extent.  There is no special switch
  or option. However, there are still several cases which are not
  handled as well as they should be, and there are no options
  controlling C++ formatting specifically.

  There is only one case I'm aware of in which the output of indent
  breaks compilation;  this is nested templates such as:

    Aaa<int, Bbb<int> > anotherAB;

  are transformed into:

    Aaa < int, Bbb < int >>anotherAB;

  which is problematic for some compilers.  This is, in my opinion,
  the fault of the incredibly brain-dead design of C++, and it's not
  clear when or if indent will deal properly with this example.

* Wide strings and characters are now handled.

* The manual page, indent.1, has been removed from the distribution
  because it is not supported and is seriously out of date (it
  corresponds to indent 1.4).

* The "-bbb" option, which forces blanklines before boxed comments,
  has been re-instated.

* Trailing spaces are removed from output.

* Line-breaking behaviour has been improved.

* The troff option has been removed.

* You may now put either C ("/* ... */") or C++ ("// ...") comments in
  the indent profile.  Options within comments are ignored.

* The K&R style of leaving procedure names on the same line as their
  type is now better supported (the option "-psl").

* The "-l" option now works more consistently.  This may change some
  behaviour by breaking lines where they were not broken before.
  Specifying an argument of "0" will turn off this option.

* The unused options "-ps" and "-nps" were removed.

* When `indent' completes its work successfully, it exits with a value
  of 0.  Otherwise, one of the following values is returned:

  1 : This means `indent' was incorrectly invoked.
  2 : Errors occurred during formatting, but processing continued.
  3 : An unrecoverable error occured during the processing of an input
      file.  If there are more input files, indent will proceed to
      process them, but will return the error value 3.
  4 : A serious internal error occured.  All processing is terminated.
  5 : A system error during processing occurred.  In this case,
     `indent' terminates.

Release notes for GNU indent version 1.9.

* All reported bugs have been fixed.

* A new option "-lc" ("--comment-line-length") was added.

* Please read the section "BUG REPORTS" in the README file.

* Unless "interesting" bugs appear, this will be the last release of
  indent version 1.  The next release planned is version 2, which will
  (hopefully) integrate support for C++, and possibly Objective C.
  Additionally, a couple more OS's may be supported.

* A volunteer is now working on the `review' program, which examines C
  code and produces the options that GNU `indent' would use to produce
  code in that style.

Release Notes for GNU indent version 1.8.

* VMS and MS-DOS are now supported.  Thanks to MEHRDAD@glum.dev.cf.ac.uk
  and hnyman@lesti.hut.fi for their contributions.

  Please note that I have no way of testing this code, and with slight
  modifications, have installed it "as is".

  Also, note that these systems do not use `configure'.  See the file
  VMS-README for details of the VMS installation.  For the MS-DOS
  version, it is expected that the compiler will recognize the define
  __MSDOS__ as being set.

* C++ comments are now recognized.  More C++ support will be
  forthcoming, possibly along with support for Objective C.

* Formatting can be disabled for sections of code by placing that code
  between lines containing the comments /* *INDENT-OFF* */ and
  /* *INDENT-ON* */ (this also works in C++ comments).  See the info
  node "Disabling Formatting" for more info.

* The processing of comments has been changed.  See the info node on
  "Comments" for a description.

* The default (i.e., GNU) behaviour of struct handling has been
  slightly changed.

* All reported bugs have been fixed.


Release Notes for GNU indent version 1.7.

* All reported bugs have been fixed, except some of those dealing with
  comments.  I have completely rewritten the comment handling code in
  indent, but since this produces rather different comment formats
  (mostly, it makes several comment-related options actually work) I
  am waiting for the next release of indent to install this.

  To see what the differences in the comment handling will be, compare
  the file `comments.texinfo' to the section on comments in the info
  node for indent.

  It is possible that I have lost some bug reports, as some of my mail
  falls into a crack between two machines.  In the future, please be
  sure to use the address "bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu".

* All errors and warnings are output on the standard error stream,
  and conform to the GNU error message format.

* There is now more support for small (i.e., 16-bit) machines.

* There have been slight changes to the default behaviour, namely:

  - Column 1 comments are not formatted.

  - Preprocessor spaces are removed.

* When "-lps" is specified, whitespace preceding the '#' character is
  left untouched, as well as following whitespace.

* When the tabsize is specified as 1 or 0 (e.g., "-ts 0"), spaces are
  used instead of tabs.  There may be bugs in this behaviour, but they
  should vanish with the new comment code.


Release Notes for GNU indent version 1.6.

* All reported bugs have been fixed.

* The makefiles have been, hopefully, improved (see the file `README'
  for installation procedure).  Essentially, it is sufficent to type
  "make" to build indent.  `indent' is distributed with `configure'
  just as other GNU software.  Thus, in conformance with the GNU
  standards, "configure; make" should function properly and `indent'
  should fit properly in a GNU software tree.  However, it is my hope
  that for most users, "make" is all they will have to type.


Release Notes for GNU indent version 1.5.

* All reported bugs (and some unreported ones) have been fixed.

* The default behaviour of `indent' has changed slightly to be more
  compatible with Emacs' C-mode.  In particular, where version 1.4
  produced code looking like:

  struct token_data
  {
    enum token_data_type type;
    union
    {
      struct
      {
	char *text;
      }
	u_t;
    }
      u;
  };

  version 1.5 now generates the following:

  struct token_data
  {
    enum token_data_type type;
    union
      {
	struct
	  {
	    char *text;
	  }
	u_t;
      }
    u;
  };

* There is a new option, "-lps" ("--leave-preprocessor-space") which
  causes `indent' to leave the space between the `#' and the command
  on preprocessor lines.

* `indent' now understands spaces between options and their arguments.
  It is thus now possible to type: "indent -ip 4 latex.c"
  Such spaces are also understood in a profile.

* indent 1.5 uses a configuration script generated by autoconf.  It
  examines the system to produce a host-dependent makefile. This has
  changed little with regard to building indent;  typing "make" will
  build `indent'.  See the file "README" for details of this process.

* The file "indent.1" is a man document for indent 1.4 sent to me by
  vogel@c-17igp.wpafb.af.mil.  The GNU project uses texinfo for its
  documentation system, so this man page will remain officially
  unsupported.  However, I will continue to distribute it as long as it
  appears reasonably up to date.

* Thanks to the folks that sent me patches.


Release Notes for GNU indent version 1.4.

Essentially, this version fixes bugs in version 1.3.





Release Notes for GNU indent version 1.3.  For more details, read the
manual.


* All reported bugs have been fixed.


* The manual has been upgraded somewhat.


* Command line syntax has changed with regard to input and output files.
  The command:

		  indent *.c

  for each file iguana.c, will indent iguana.c into iguana.c, after
  first making a backup copy.

		  indent liver_oil.c -o gullet.c

		  cat liver_oil.c | indent -o gullet.c

		  indent liver_iol.c -st > gullet.c

  Each of the above will indent "liver_oil.c" into "gullet.c".  The
  "-st" ("--standard-output") option can only be used when the
  standard input, or only a single input file is specified.

  It is also possible to use the standard input by specifying the single
  filename "-" on the command line.  In this case, no other files may
  be specified.


* indent now makes GNU-style backup files.

  This behaviour is controlled by two environment variables,
  VERSION_CONTROL and SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.

  VERSION_CONTROL determines what kinds of backups are made.  If it's
  value is "numbered", then the first modification of some file
  "eraserhead.c" will yield a backup file "eraserhead.c.~1~", the
  second modification will yield "eraserhead.c.~2~", and so on.  It
  does not matter if the version numbers are not a sequence;  the next
  version will be one greater than the highest in that directory.

  If the value of VERSION_CONTROL is "numbered_existing", then such
  numbered backups will be made if there are already numbered backup
  versions of the file.  Otherwise, the backup name will be that of
  the original file with "~" (tilde) appended.  E.g., "eraserhead.c~".

  If the value of VERSION_CONTROL is "simple", then the backup name
  will be that of the original file with "~" appended, regardless of
  whether or not there exist numbered versions in the directory.

  For simple backups, the value of SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX will be used
  rather than "~" if it is set.

  If VERSION_CONTROL is unset, "numbered_existing" is assumed.  For
  lisp lovers, "nil" is equivalent to "numbered_existing" and "t" is
  equivalent to "numbered".

  Finally, if VERSION_CONTROL is "none" or "never", backups are not
  made.  I suggest you avoid this behaviour.

  Note also that backup files are made in the directory of the source
  file, not the current directory (where indent was invoked).


* Only one indent profile is read.  indent searches first for a
  profile in the current directory and reads that if found.
  Otherwise, indent looks for a profil in the home directory.


* "-nip" is now handled.  This is equivalent to "-ip0".


* The long name for "-bs" has been changed from "--Bill_Shannon" to
  "--blank_after_sizeof".


Release notes for GNU indent version 1.7

* The default style of indent is now the GNU style.  The option "-gnu"
  is still recognized.  To obtain the original indent default, use
  "-orig".  It is possible to obtain the original defaults by compiling
  args.c with -DBERKELEY_DEFAULTS.

* Long options are now handled, prefaced by either "+" or "--".

* A new option, "-ts", allows specification of tab sizes.

* All reported bugs have been fixed.

* The man format of documentation is no longer included.  indent.texinfo
  is the official document, in accordance with GNU standards.
  Investigate the program "texi2roff" for generating a MAN page.
