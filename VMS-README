The code for indent under VMS was contributed by MEHRDAD@glum.dev.cf.ac.uk

The rest of this file describes how to build indent under VMS.



If you are using GCC, you should run GNUC-MAKE.COM.

If you have VAXC on your machine, run VAXC-MAKE.COM, to create
indent.exe.  When compiling INDENT sources, VAXC will issue warning
messages about the length of some external identifiers. You can
ignore these warnings.

Set up symbol INDENT as a foreign command, for example:

    INDENT :== "$DUA0:[INDENT-DIR]INDENT.EXE"

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS

The function for reading, `read', is defined by the macro SYS_READ.
By default under VMS, this is defined to be the functions `vms_read'
defined in io.c.

People have sent me various versions of this function, with differring
semantics.  I have no way of testing these, so I have done my best to
1) ensure the correctness of the function, and 2) use the algorithm
most folks seem to suggest.


If you experience problems in the read function, you might try using
the plain, system read.  You can also sent me a bug report, if you
think you have a clue to the problem.  See the file README for reporting
bugs.
